# ReadMe Generator

## Description
This application uses Node.js to create a complete Readme file based on the input provided by the user. Using the Inquirer command line interface, the user will be prompted with a serious of questions via the integrated terminal. Once the questionnaire is compelte, the responses will automatically populate into a template, complete with markdown syntax. Other features include a fully functional Table of Contents for easier navigation of longer documents, a badge that will be generated once a license is selected, and e-mail and repository links that are generated from the user's e-mail address and github username.

## Installation
Outside of the source code, a package.json file will be required for dependencies. Run "npm init" to complete this process, then install Inquirer CLI by entering "inquirer npm i inquirer@8.2.4". 

## Usage
The Readme Generator reduces the time required to create a standard Readme file by eliminating the need to create the outline for every single project. Simply run the application in the terminal and the document will be fully complete once the responses are entered from the questionnaire.
